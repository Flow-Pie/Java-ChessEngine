## Project Overview 🧩

This project is a Java-based chess engine designed to simulate a chess game on a virtual board. The game implements the logic for all chess pieces, including Pawns, Knights, Bishops, Rooks, Queens, and Kings, as well as the rules that govern piece movement. The engine includes a GUI that displays the board and allows players to interact with the pieces through mouse events.

The project is organized into well-structured code that separates the logic for the board, pieces, and game flow. It also includes a set of resources for the chess piece images, making it visually appealing.

## Features ✨
- Full chessboard representation with 8x8 grid.
- All chess pieces: Pawn, Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, and King.
- Piece movement based on chess rules.
- Drag-and-drop functionality for piece movement.
- Basic check and checkmate conditions.
- Support for white and black pieces.
- Easy-to-use GUI for an interactive chess experience.

## Usage 🚀

To run the chess game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Java-ChessEngine.git
   ```

2. **Compile the source code**:
   If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, simply open the project and build it. Alternatively, use the command line:
   ```bash
   javac -d out/ src/com/main/*.java src/com/piece/*.java
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   Navigate to the compiled class files directory and run the `Main.class`:
   ```bash
   java com.main.Main
   ```

4. **Play chess!** The GUI will launch, allowing you to interact with the game.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
